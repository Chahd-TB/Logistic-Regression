# 🧠 Logistic Regression – Machine Learning TP

This project implements Logistic Regression, Regularized Logistic Regression, and Softmax Regression from scratch, and applies them to three real datasets.
It also includes comparisons with Scikit-Learn’s built-in models.

# 📘 Overview

The goal of this assignment is to understand and implement:

Logistic regression for binary classification

Regularization to prevent overfitting

Softmax regression for multi-class classification

# 📊 Datasets Used
# 1️⃣ Student Admission Dataset

Predict whether a student is admitted to university based on two exam scores.

Features: Exam 1 score, Exam 2 score

Target:

1 → Admitted

0 → Not admitted

# 2️⃣ Microchip QA Dataset

Predict whether a microchip passes quality assurance based on test results.

Features: Two test scores per chip

Target:

1 → Accepted

0 → Rejected

Includes: Regularization to handle non-linear decision boundaries

# 3️⃣ Iris Dataset 🌸

Classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using Softmax Regression.

Features: Sepal & petal measurements

Target: 3 flower classes

Goal: Explore multi-class logistic regression
